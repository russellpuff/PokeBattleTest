# PokeBattleTest
Dead project. Doomed to rot. 

This was supposed to be a recreation of the Pokemon battle system centered around "BattleEffect" objects. While on a rudimentary level, it accomplishes this,
the way the BattleEffects have been implemented and the way the Pokemon battle system is innately designed clashes so heavily it just resulted in me,
adding patch after patch to the system to accomodate a lot of things the BattleEffect system wasn't designed for. 

This project was for university, and was submitted in this broken half-finished state due to time constraints. It will likely never be finished, but remains
as a part of my portfolio.
